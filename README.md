# file-compression-and-decompression-based-on-huffman-code

## Introduction
Compression software has been used more and more frequently in our daily lives. However, few people knows how compression software works to help us compress the files and save the memory.In this program, we implement the huffman algorithm in C++ which could help you learn and understand the secrets behind compression/decompression. Without losing any bits in the original files, huffman algorithm is a strong and efficient way to compress/decompress files. We will explain the methodology behind this project below.
