# file-compression-and-decompression-based-on-huffman-code

## Introduction
Compression software has been used more and more frequently in our daily lives. But seldom people know how the compression software helped us to compress the files and save the memory.In this program, we implemented the huffman algorithm in C++ which could help you guys learning and understanding the secrets behind compression/decompression. Without losing any bits in the original files, huffman algorithm is a strong and efficient way to compress/decompress files. We will explained the methodology behind this project below.
